# EC2 Pandas/Numpy Compatibility Fix

## 🐛 **Problem**
```
ValueError: numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. 
Expected 96 from C header, got 88 from PyObject
```

This error occurs when pandas and numpy versions are incompatible due to binary compilation differences.

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### **Quick Fix: Removed Unused Pandas Import**

Since pandas was imported but never actually used in the scoring service, I removed it entirely:

**File**: `enhanced_scoring_service.py`
```python
# Before
import pandas as pd

# After  
# pandas import removed - not used
```

**File**: `requirements_production.txt`
```python
# Before
pandas==2.0.3

# After
# pandas==2.0.3  # Removed - not used in scoring service
```

## 🚀 **Deploy the Fix**

On your EC2 instance:

```bash
# Pull the updated code
cd /home/hadoop/hdfs-anomaly-detection
git pull

# Start the scoring service (no pandas dependency now)
python3 enhanced_scoring_service.py
```

## 🔧 **Alternative Solutions** (if you need pandas later)

### **Solution 1: Reinstall both packages**
```bash
pip3 uninstall pandas numpy -y
pip3 install numpy pandas
```

### **Solution 2: Use compatible versions**
```bash
pip3 uninstall pandas numpy -y
pip3 install numpy==1.24.3 pandas==2.0.3
```

### **Solution 3: System packages (Amazon Linux)**
```bash
sudo yum install python3-devel gcc gcc-c++ -y
pip3 uninstall pandas numpy -y
pip3 install --no-cache-dir numpy pandas
```

### **Solution 4: User install**
```bash
pip3 install --user --upgrade numpy pandas
```

## 📋 **Updated Production Requirements**

Your production environment now only needs these packages:

```
kafka-python==2.0.2
requests==2.31.0  
urllib3==2.0.4
watchdog==3.0.0
setuptools>=65.0.0
wheel>=0.37.0
```

## ✅ **Benefits of This Fix**

1. **🚀 Faster startup** - No pandas import overhead
2. **💾 Lower memory usage** - Pandas not loaded
3. **🔧 Fewer dependencies** - Reduced compatibility issues
4. **⚡ Immediate solution** - No need to reinstall packages

The scoring service will work exactly the same since pandas wasn't being used anyway!
